Generator Structure: 4 layers of 64, 128, 512 and 1024 nodes respectively.
Dicriminator Structure: 3 layers of 128, 512 and 1024 nodes respectively.

Input size:	124 x 128 x 1
Output size:	128 x 192 x 1

All else as standard in keras gan.py example.

Comments:
After 30,000 epochs, can produce some very good images, but very inconsistently.  Discriminator gets very high accuracy, will try with fewer layers for discriminator and more for generator.
After 50,000 epochs, is getting more consistent.  Still not at an acceptable level, but an improvement.
