These were all fairly similar experiments, all run quite briefly.  The resolution was lowered since the first attempt, which has helped keep them from all being the same.
Each has one or two variables changed from the 'standard', which is the keras example.
Each of the models was run for a different number of epochs.  The number of the foder housing the outputs is the number of epochs the model was trained to get those outputs.
