Microsoft GANS Project

This is a Microsoft project for GANs, which is part of Programming Project II module in Trinity College Dublin.

In order to get this to work, you need to read the ReadMe, which is in the Keras-GAN folder. 

This code is a WIP, and is not perfect. Results may vary depending on the machine and the dataset used when running the code. 

This code was adapted and changed to suit our needs. It's Open Source, so feel free to adapt it to your own needs, and expand on the GAN technology. You will need to source your own datasets, which are available online from various universities around the globe. 

Our project was run in PyCharm IDE, and the compatibility with other IDEs.
